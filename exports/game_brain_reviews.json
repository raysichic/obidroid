As you progress the dungeons get harder but you're stuck with the same monsters, maxed out that aren't even strong enough to get the evo material you need.

Only issue I have is that when playing in increased difficulty (hard or higher) the tiles are too tiny to see. Would be fine on a computer-or even maybe a tablet screen, but too tiny on a phone screen.  This however, is not really the game's fault...and it does allow you to magnify the tiles, it's just that on a phone screen, if you magnify, the whole puzzle won't fit.  Like I said, not the fault of the app, just my own peeve. "

Please, make it do a move I didn't anticipate. I get tired of winning all the time. Also, could use some color-scheme options.   2 stars. Make the game more intelligent and I could up it to 4. Create a few color-scheme options and I might up it to 5. "
