Also I cannot find allot of the artist I want. I do not listen a whole lot to secular music being a Christian. So I would really love to be able to find all the Christian artist I like. So what I am saying is, Pandora, please update your genre list to include all Christian artist, not just some. Like Christian Dance music, or DJs, as a prime example.
