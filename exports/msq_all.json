              u'  This game is fun but has way to many glitches, I was really into it and qualified to be one the show then one day had a million negative points that will not go up , as well as no longer getting bonuses for winning bouts. I wish it would be fixed:( '),
             (u'Potential',
              u'  Consistent performance is a must when you tell everyone theres a chance at real money for playing.  A late Android release.  Crashes every other match.  Constant ads, that create visual glitches.   This all makes for an unhappy group of people.  Considering androids larger market share you are doing damage to your ratings by offering such a poorly made app. '),
             (u'You forgot',
              u"  Forgot to include the most important feature of a good application: the ability to use it. It doesn't work! Very laggy, freezes a lot, error messages aplenty. Very poorly made. If the TV show is this bad it won't last two episodes. "),
             (u'boring',
              u"  Boring game. It's like every other game that's trivia except you have to think fast. Which doesnt matter. Most of the time the person I'm playing against isn't even playing... "),
             (u'Stupid game now',
              u'  This was a great game until they added the "NULL" option. Now they show wrong answers about half the time. I would have given it 5 stars but now I\'m uninstalling '),

              u'  When I select play, it will search for player and goes black screen and finally crash.... ')],
