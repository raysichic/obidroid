 'reviews': [(u'Good game...too many glitches',
              u'  This game is fun but has way to many glitches, I was really into it and qualified to be one the show then one day had a million negative points that will not go up , as well as no longer getting bonuses for winning bouts. I wish it would be fixed:( '),
             (u'Potential',
              u'  Consistent performance is a must when you tell everyone theres a chance at real money for playing.  A late Android release.  Crashes every other match.  Constant ads, that create visual glitches.   This all makes for an unhappy group of people.  Considering androids larger market share you are doing damage to your ratings by offering such a poorly made app. '),
             (u'You forgot',
              u"  Forgot to include the most important feature of a good application: the ability to use it. It doesn't work! Very laggy, freezes a lot, error messages aplenty. Very poorly made. If the TV show is this bad it won't last two episodes. "),
             (u'boring',
              u"  Boring game. It's like every other game that's trivia except you have to think fast. Which doesnt matter. Most of the time the person I'm playing against isn't even playing... "),
             (u'Stupid game now',
              u'  This was a great game until they added the "NULL" option. Now they show wrong answers about half the time. I would have given it 5 stars but now I\'m uninstalling '),
             (u'Crash 24/7',
              u'  When I select play, it will search for player and goes black screen and finally crash.... '),
             (u'Great concept,
              u'  But since the last update it locks up and freezes all the time. Resulting in losing bonuses and games making my stats inaccurate. Please fix whatever it was that the update messed up. '),
             (u'Why',
              u'  Why do I have negative points!? Update this game already, or is the government hindering you from doing anything? Blast! '),
             (u'It's giving the wrong answers',
              u'  Everything a bell rings Ann Angel gets its wings.I said that and it got marked wrong '),

                u' Really informative'),

              u' Was so excited to play this, but just shows up as error messages when I try to open the app. Please fix soon. GS4'),
             (u'Love it',
              u'  Can't wait until next season. The only reason the app isn't doing better is due to the short season. '),
             (u'All time favorite!',
              u'   love the game but can't figure out how to play with a Facebook friend, please help! '),
             (u'Really fun, but buggy',
              u'  UPDATE: since the update, it always freezes! Ugh! I absolutely love this game. Very addictive and the more you play, the better you get. I just had a 7 game winning streak. The more you win, the higher your bonus points go. Well, the next round, it just kept searching and searching for a challenger, but never found one... or at least I thought. I hit the back key, and started the process over. Apparently someone played me while the app froze and stole the Money Chair. This has happened a few times. '),

              u' Everytime I try to launch the app it freezes. If I leave the app, come back 2 minutes later, frozen again! & I want to be able to play with friends. What is your definition of "coming soon"?'),

             (u'Screen turns off/can't change answer,
              u' While waiting to load bout screen shuts down and locks right when 1st question loads. Other games have a setting to keep it on. Also more than once accidentally hit the wrong answer but can not change it. My phone screen is sensitive and picks up the wrong thing sometimes. Should be able to change answer if still in allowed time.'),
             (u'Awsome app',
              u' I took the money chair in the offline game and got soo many points.The android tablet cant sync with the tv at times but comes up a while after.Great game though!!!! It also appears that nobody seems to try to answer the quiestion in the offline game and I win. But its AWSOME.'),
             (u'I could never get the game to sync with the app just right. Had ...',
              u' ... I could never get the game to sync with the app just right. Had horrible times trying to keep a connection. Wouldn't let me answer the questions when asked. I was super excited to play the first time, and then all the problems. Cool idea if it would work!    Fix all the bugs and it would b cool')
