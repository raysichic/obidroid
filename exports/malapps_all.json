First is active development and continuous improvement.  They just keep adding features like the pin then multi-devices, passphrase protected backup, etc.  Not to mention refining the interface.  Second is support.  On several occasions I had to contact them for help on various issues (all as a result of user error, btw) and every time they responded in under 30 mins and helped me get things working again.  Third is for folks who use Google authenticator.  Just how much do you want to put in the Google pot?  I think it's better to isolate the 2nd factor of the two factor with different folks.  Conclusion, Authy makes 2 factor easy for both multiple accounts and on multiple devices with a great interface. "

What would be even better is if 'Authy' can do left and right swipes and use top or bottom for offscreen menu. That would keep it consistent with general practice.  Secondly, the features are really awesome. Usually for security related apps, more features = more security holes. But 'Authy' manages to pull it off with right balance. And 'Authy' blog is a very interesting read explaining the features and the thinking behind them.  One more star waiting for the swipe gestures. "
