Ive used this to work from home whilst my laptop is being repaired. Ive been able to operate and access full functionality. Its great and reliable. Better than x2 client and doesnt require software on the desktop machine to work, just ip address and password\" Matthew Wood - January 9, 2013\" Matthew Wood\"I have tried other RDP apps and PocketCloud is by far the most polished one. The interface is very mature and I can easily use it on my mobile phone, tablet, and mini PC with physical keyboard attachment. If you want an easy to use and straight forward RDP client, then PocketCloud is for you.\" A Google User\"This app is just brilliant. Took me 3 minutes to install, connect and manage my remote Windows 2008 server, without once referring to any of the documentation. Controls are fantastic, it's quick, and I use it on my tablet in preference to my laptop and rdc.
