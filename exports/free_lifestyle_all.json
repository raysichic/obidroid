Over 12,000,000 items have already been exchanged on Listia! Listia is a fun and free online marketplace where users can get rid of things they don't need anymore and get stuff they want in return, for free. You receive credits anytime you give something away and use those credits to get free stuff you really want from other users. The more stuff you give away, the more free things you can get. Listia's marketplace is much like eBay, but you use credits to bid on auctions instead of cash, so everything is free. How It Works: 1. A user lists something they don't want anymore (like an old cell phone) . 2. Other users bid on the cell phone using credits they received for signing up and listing their own stuff. 3. When the auction ends, the user who bid the highest amount of credits wins! 4. The winner gets the cell phone, and the lister gets credits to use for something else on Listia... Here is a tutorial for even more information, http://www.listia.com/howitworks The mobile app makes giving away stuff even easier. Just take a photo with your device, enter a few brief details and post it to Listia instantly. You can also use the phone to see what people are giving away nearby through the geo location feature, bid on other items and receive instant notifications any time you are outbid or an item you are watching is ending soon.
