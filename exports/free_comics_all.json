If it does open the archive, then there is a chance for corrupted images full of artifacts. The back button doesn't behave like it does in other apps, causing mistaken exits highly likely.

"], ["Solution to low memory error", "  This app is not to blame for that error, I received the error on a few files, after some research, it's linked to the technology being used to read the comics.  CBR files are the issue.  Phones and tablets have trouble with the way they are read.  Easiest solution out there: Download a program like (ComicRack) for windows or mac, find your CBR file in the program by using their explorer, right click the file, choose Export Books, then select convert file to CBZ.  CBZ files are working fine. no error.  There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use \"Calibre\" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once.

Marvel's modern incarnation dates from 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others.Marvel counts among its characters such well-known properties as Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, the Silver Surfer, and the Avengers and antagonists such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Magneto, Doctor Doom, Loki, Galactus, Thanos, and the Red Skull. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with locations that mirror real-life cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.Marvel Comics and its major, longtime competitor DC Comics (owned by Disney's main rival Time Warner) shared over 80% of the American comic-book market in 2008.", "devmail": "1smilesoft1@gmail.com", "devprivacyurl": "N.A.", "devurl": "N.A.", "id": "com.marv.marvelherowallpapers", "install": "1,000 - 5,000", "moreFromDev": "None", "name": "Supreme Heroes Wallpapers", "price": 0.0, "rating": [[" 1 ", 1], [" 3 ", 0], [" 4 ", 0], [" 5 ", 6], [" 2 ", 0]], "reviews": [["Fantastic collection", "  Best i've seen till now "], ["Didn't work!", "  Every time I set it, it comes out black!
