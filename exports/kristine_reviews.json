I've been having minor problems so I wrote to their players support staff looking for help and got a prompt reply with multiple questions about the problems. It was obvious they were genuinely trying to help me. Although my problem hasn't been fixed yet, there's no doubt in my mind they're still working on it. Very very impressed by the game AND the staff. Keep it up :) "

I play it mainly for the bingo game and I've been playing for 8 months and I can count how many bingos I've had on one hand.... You started with a great design, but now the bingo boards are really small and I can't even use my stylus to press the spots. Make it so my stylus can be used at least in the video bingo since the boards have gotten even smaller! "
