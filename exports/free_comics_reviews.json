CBR files are the issue.  Phones and tablets have trouble with the way they are read.  Easiest solution out there: Download a program like (ComicRack) for windows or mac, find your CBR file in the program by using their explorer, right click the file, choose Export Books, then select convert file to CBZ.  CBZ files are working fine. no error.  There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use \"Calibre\" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once.
