Thank youUPGRADE NOTE:There is a pref to turn off autoplaying when you have 1 legal move if you don't like itIf your shortcut stops working, either move the app from the SDCard to main memory or delete the shortcut and make a new one. Android doesn't seem to update the shortcut when an app is updated from the market. FAQ Q)  Why did I just lose 100 points? A) In standard spades if you get 10 over tricks, you lose 100 points. You can turn the bag penalty off in the settings. Q) The game is bidding for me? A) Please double check that you are not playing Mirror spadesQ) Why does the app need the accounts permissionA) To allow the user to login with their google Plus accountWe are trying out AppLovin as our ad provider.

When you are trying to get a win only collectable you have to open all the chests and it gets costly.    original review After update when playing auto bingo it makes bad calls! calls bingo when there is not one.
