It downloaded but every time I try to open it there is a white screen then it hops back to my apps page. Or it will say its not responding and I must force close. I tried everything to remedy it. deleting, re installing and putting it on Sd card instead of internal memory. Nothing. I am about to give up and just be sad I never got to try it. Hopefully it'll be fixed someday. For now I'd give it zero stars if possible. So bummed out :/ "

Best i could get was 22%   stressed (found one which was 100%, the absolute weakest bridge possible that isn't a \"fail\").  A great app for getting an intuitive grasp of bridge mechanics without needing the math (even if you know the math this is faster). "

Only issue I have is that when playing in increased difficulty (hard or higher) the tiles are too tiny to see. Would be fine on a computer-or even maybe a tablet screen, but too tiny on a phone screen.  This however, is not really the game's fault...and it does allow you to magnify the tiles, it's just that on a phone screen, if you magnify, the whole puzzle won't fit.

If you write down drawn bones for a higher amount of games you'll be able to verify that there is no pattern or bias. Also the bot does not cheat, but it can easily calculate his chances to block and score and will act accordingly.",

Please, make it do a move I didn't anticipate. I get tired of winning all the time. Also, could use some color-scheme options.   2 stars. Make the game more intelligent and I could up it to 4.
