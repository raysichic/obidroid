This is the fastest way to write or swipe in an Android. Thanks. "], ["These guys got it write!", "  TouchPal is the obvious successor to the original Shapewriter keyboard.  The logic behind punctuation, super fast shape writing recognition, simple smileys and stuff, prediction and context is right on, and it seems to automatically save your custom words.  I've tried all the shape writing keyboards and this one wins, hands down.  Like any shape writing keyboard, if you're not used to this style of typing, it will take you a day or two to get into the swing of things, but after that you'll never look back. "], ["Good, but predictive getting to be unbearable each update..", "  Thought I'd update my review after yet another update that makes the once good predictive text even worse. What is going on? It used to learn, it's apparently 'intelligent' - not now. It now wants to capitalise every other word & constantly gives me 1st choices of words I hardly ever use! "], ["FAncy but not as functional", "  As u can see if ur a fast typer the caps sometimes stick together with the second word. I chose this because it has Buhua input, but u cant take away simplified Chinese which makes it very not user friendly. The outlook is fancy but if u want to input numbers or symbols it is annoying as well. I rate it a 4 because it has functions that other keyboard app doesnt provide.
