Print from almost anywhere in Android.  The downside is that you don't get the option to see a *print preview*. Seeing a print preview helps to make last minute corrections to the print settings before printing and wasting paper and toner. This issue is also apparent when printing from Google apps (they don't use this particular app to print but do use Cloud Print). I have noticed that printing spreadsheets (Google Drive Sheets) can turn out terribly small spreadsheets even when choosing to print on the correct paper size with the correct orientation... But Google Drive Docs print just fine... Also printing landscape pictures are defaulted to portrait printing. Without Print Preview it is easy to overlook this which means that your photo will print on only about half the page...  As far as printing from anywhere goes. The app can only print from an app that uses the global share menu. Some apps don't have this option for various reasons.
