Thank you.Instructions & Recommendations:- Recording HD video requires a lot of CPU/GPU power. On some devices you may get low-fps and jerky videos. If so, try decreasing resolution on the settings page.- Please note that at the moment the app supports only mp3 tracks! It won't accept audio in other formats (wma, mp4a, ogg etc)!- Video recording requires a lot of free space on SD card. The app will warn if free space on your SD is below 300M and will block or stop recording if it falls below 100M.- Please disable the \"Do not keep activities\" option in the Settings/Developer options/Apps. It might cause issues on some devices (endless app restart).VideoFX uses ffmpeg under LGPL license and libjpeg-turbo under BSD license", "devmail": "dev@fuzebits.com", "devprivacyurl": "N.A.", "devurl": "http://fuzebits.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEk6S_Sm8ol0K7wjHMcvY92bgKUDw", "id": "com.videofx", "install": "500,000 - 1,000,000", "moreFromDev": "None", "name": "VideoFX Music Video Maker", "price": 0.0, "rating": [[" 5 ", 6173], [" 2 ", 313], [" 4 ", 1704], [" 1 ", 650], [" 3 ", 938]], "reviews": [["Good but it freezes", "  Its a great app but when i watch or film the video it freezes for a second which is really annoying.
