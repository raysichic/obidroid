And I usually get tired of a game after a few days, but this one is just some good classic fun if you have a bit of spare time. "], ["Awsome !!!", "  I Love this game -get caught up in hours playing even though I just installed it - quite easy to get addicted - real lots of fun "], ["Could change some things IMO, but pretty good as is.", "  Camera angle could be lower to see more cars ahead, even with fully upgraded brakes on the Skyline it's not enough to stop in time if every lane is blocked. Cars merging into you last second gets kind of annoying as well. More cars and customization couldn't hurt, maybe add a suspension upgrade that lowers the cars and gives them less body roll. "], ["Great game!", "  This is the best highway racer I've played on a mobile device!... And the car selection is perfect, all of the right cars are in this game... If development continues on the title, I'd love to see more cars added like: RX-7's, Porsches, the R34, etc. Also improve the sound FX by adding Turbo BOV sounds, the rotory sound of the RX-7, backfires from the exhaust, etc... Just the little things that would turn this from a really cool game, into a ridiculously awesome title... "], ["Best Tilting Screen Game Out There", "  I hate games that use the screen/phone/tablet to steer or turn. I can't stand the Asphalt games because you sit there turning your phone upside down and the sensitivity is always off. This game actually gets it right. It's not perfect, but it's tolerable and easy enough to actually play.   As for the endless running aspect, those are typically my favorite types of games. I enjoy subway surfers but it is too easy and doesn't challenge your reflexes quite like this game. This game actually surprises "], ["Fantastic game", "  Simple to learn, hours of fun, and oddly, quite relaxing.  Improvements needed: make the distance traveled realistic. If u go full speed on a supra for like 10 min, it says only 3 km driven. Also, maybe allow mph instead of kmh. Also, maybe a motorcycle and some motorcycles moped in traffic.  Thank you for making a great fun game!
