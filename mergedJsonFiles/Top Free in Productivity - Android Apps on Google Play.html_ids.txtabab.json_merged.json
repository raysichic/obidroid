It is also a task management tool which can manage all the installed apps on your phone.The task management mechanism of android system has been changed after the release of the version 2.2 of the android system. Task killers cannot kill the services and notifications on your phone.By use of the Advanced Task Manager, you can thoroughly stop tasks in the following steps:  1) long press the task that you want to stop 2) chose the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153force stop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option3) press the the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153force stop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd button on the application info system panelIf you want to manage running services, click menu->service, then it will open the system service panel where you can stop running services.**Please note that installing the following apps such as: Advanced Task Killer, Super Task Killer FREE, ES Task Manager, Automatic Task Killer, Mobo Task Killer, Android Booster together with Advanced Task Manager may make your phone unstable or cause potential conflict.**\u00e2\u2013\u00a0 FAQ-----------------------------Q: Why do apps restart again after killing?A: Some apps are restarted by system events. Apps cannot be prevented from restarting because of system limitation. We suggest you to enable auto kill in settings, and it will kill tasks on every screen off. It will help to save battery life and release memory for the phone.Q: How can I add apps to the ignore list?A: You can long press the task that you want to ignore, and then you will get a poped up context menu, click \"Ignore\". The ignored apps will not be shown in the task list, and will never be killed. You can manage the ignored apps in settings.Q: How can I manage startup apps?There is \"Startup Kill\" in settings. It can help you to kill tasks when system starts up.\u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Trademark-----------------------------The Android robot is modified from work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License.#KWapp killer, app manager, android booster, app kill", "devmail": "support@infolife.mobi", "devprivacyurl": "http://www.infolife.mobi/privacy.html&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNH829UBoMNrkHMfbhhSd4fuul4aWQ", "devurl": "http://infolife.mobi&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHA9WQqj-HiOu8aenCWU19SFq78Kw", "id": "mobi.infolife.taskmanager", "install": "10,000,000 - 50,000,000", "moreFromDev": ["mobi.infolife.gamebooster", "mobi.infolife.app2sd", "mobi.infolife.cache", "mobi.infolife.appbackup", "mobi.infolife.taskmanagerpro", "mobi.infolife.eraser", "mobi.infolife.batterysaver", "mobi.infolife.installer", "mobi.infolife.launcher2", "mobi.infolife.itip", "mobi.infolife.percentage", "mobi.infolife.eraserpro", "mobi.infolife.uninstaller", "mobi.infolife.itag", "mobi.infolife.cwwidget", "mobi.infolife.smsbackup"], "name": "Advanced Task Manager - Killer", "price": 0.0, "rating": [[" 2 ", 2118], [" 5 ", 156679], [" 3 ", 10109], [" 1 ", 3303], [" 4 ", 39865]], "reviews": [["Auto Kill Interval", "  I have a few apps which relaunch immediately after auto-kill.  It would help to have a list to which apps can be added which auto-kills the apps at a shorter interval (in my case, I do not need apps such as radio or certain social apps running after I exit--they should remain killed after I exit [having an exclusive list with a user-programmable kill interval of select apps would serve such purpose].)
