Also it starts all the downloads automatically which is completely retarded and makes no sense. So with the problem I mentioned its awful. I should have to tell it to download something, it should not start random crap on its own. I had high hopes but they did not come close to being met, will most likely delete this app. Also if you want something good (cant have apple device) try finding tv portal. download it and an app called loader droid. Perfect combo for downloading nearly any free tv show/movie. Sorry for the giant posts, trying to be honest and helpful. And mx player is the best video player I have found btw.
