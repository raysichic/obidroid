"], ["Very fun but not worth the time", "  I really, really like this game, but I have to give it 2 stars since I'm uninstalling it. You have to have pickaxes to advance, but they are so ridiculously hard to come by. You should at least be able to earn a reasonable amount within tne game...without having to dload other games. Until they change that, I am removing it...it's also why I'm only rating it 2 stars. :( "], ["Stupid pickaxe system ruins otherwise fun game.", "  This game is pretty fun...until you run out of pickaxes.  You have to have pickaxes to explore and to advance in the game.  The only way to get more is...to download other games and apps, and put time and money into them, for just one or a few pickaxes each.  Seriously?  This is stupid.
