Drag racing is a well-conceived, well executed racer that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep petrolheads coming back for more.\" - Michael Brook, Life of Android ***TIPS:0. Updating the game- Your cars and money are saved on your device. DO NOT EVER uninstall the game before updating, or you will lose ALL of your stuff.1. Racing- Launch and shift when the dashboard indicator turns blue or green - If there is too much wheelspin, you are not going anywhere - watch the orange indicator on your dashboard - Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy - Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial!2. Cars and upgrades- Test drive before you buy a car!- The more your car costs, the tougher opposition you'll face both offline and online- Upgrades count towards increasing car cost/level, while tuning doesn't- Keep your car cost just under your level cap to get an advantage- Adjusting gear ratios (Garage -> Upgrade -> Tune) is costly, but lets you achieve times that are impossible on stock settings3. Game modes and winnings- Race against beginner/amateur AI to get some quick cash and build your car- Defeat bosses and unlock achievements for extra RP- Go online and race against others to earn maximum cash/RP- If your car isn't ready for online races, earn some cash in \"Drivers Battle\"- For the ultimate challenge, race against top players in Pro League4. Misc- Like http://facebook.com/DragRacingGame for news and strategy- Visit the official forums: http://www.dragracingforum.net- Try playing with vibration on (enable it in the \"Settings\" menu)!- If the game runs slow on your phone, use the task manager to kill unnecessary background tasks- XPERIA PLAY Optimized", "devmail": "support@creative-mobile.com", "devprivacyurl": "http://creative-mobile.com/nitro-nation-drag-racing-privacy-policy/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNGj5aVwAkdkQS53UIUk0qoJYCyMvw", "devurl": "http://creative-mobile.com/game/drag-racing/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE50bV8CUiiISY3uFK_bYYxjczS4A", "id": "com.creativemobile.DragRacing", "install": "100,000,000 - 500,000,000", "moreFromDev": ["com.creativemobile.pixitgame", "com.creativemobile.cod", "com.creativemobile.n2o", "com.creativemobile.dragracingbe", "com.creativemobile.dr4x4", "com.creativemobile.tanks", "com.creativemobile.bb3d", "com.creativemobile.badblood", "com.creativemobile.digger.free"], "name": "Drag Racing", "price": 0.0, "rating": [[" 4 ", 137852], [" 5 ", 703900], [" 2 ", 14970], [" 1 ", 35896], [" 3 ", 48866]], "reviews": [["HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT", "  So in the space of a day or so, Creative Mobile has released Nitro Nation to a few anointed souls, and have demolished their other fine Drag Racing game.
