No more need to look through all your apps to find a game.Millions of people have put their trust into ZEDGE\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 and we want to keep it that way. Here's the background on why we ask for certain permissions:YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATIONREAD CONTACT DATA and WRITE CONTACT DATAWe need these permissions in order to set contact ringtones in the app. Without this it's impossible to offer the \"set as contact ringtone\" feature which many of you appreciate. We DO NOT read, transfer, store or use any of your personal information or contact data. This permission has always been required - we did not add it recently.FAQ:Q: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not able to find popular music ringtones or mp3 music on Zedge. Why?A: Zedge respects that commercial artists normally want money for their music and that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give it away for free. We respect that. Zedge is not about music BUT about huge amounts of unique and rare stuff made and shared by people and independent artists from all parts of the world.RINGTONE CATEGORIESAlternative, Blues, Bollywood, Children, Christian & Gospel, Classical, Comedy, Country, Dance, Electronica, Entertainment, Games, Hip Hop, Holiday, Jazz, Latin, Message, Tones, News & Politics, Other, Pets & Animals, Pop, R&B / Soul, Reggae, Rock, Sayings, Sound Effects, WorldWALLPAPER CATEGORIESAbstract, Anime, Auto & Vehicles, Babes, Bollywood, Comedy, Designs, Drawn / Cartoons, Entertainment, Games, Holiday / Occasions, Themes, Hunks, Logos, Love, Music, Nature / Landscape, News & Politics, Other, People, Pets & Animals, Signs & Sayings, Spiritual, Sport, TechnologyTAGSwallpapers, hd wallpapers, live wallpapers, themes, games, social games, backgrounds, background images, hd, theme, ringtones, ring tones, hd, contact ringtones, message tones, notification sounds, notifications, alarm sounds, alarms, alert sounds, alerts, tone, tones, sounds.",

Would have given it 5 stars if picks weren't required for quests or you earned more to use for the quests. You get stuck with no quests that you can complete because they require picks you have to buy with real money. Good idea for a game but poorly executed. You spend more time doing free offers, trying to get picks, than you do playing the game. "

I wish the reviews indicated that it works. But it needs a complete integration with all data types that the real Google Earth supports.) And it would tell me what coordinates I'm pointing to. And a real Google Earth would have a scale bar! I keep on seeing references about it being able to compute routes but I don't see any options to do that. Touching the \"Google Earth\" logo (upper left) brings up the layer selection but only if I've brought up the Settings menu at least once during the session. There's no distance scale. And when I specify coordinates, it quite often doesn't recognize the input or plots the point wrong when it does. (It doesn't systematically know that latitude INCREASES \"\"UPWARDS\"!) And the 9/25 and 10/3 updates maintained the status quo. I'd uninstall it if Google Maps had a Share option. The 10/10 update degraded coordinate input. The 11/5 update didn't fix/add anything.

        "description": "\"Plays like Grand Theft Auto behind bars... prison has never been such an open world!\"Wrestling Revolution's unique brand of violence finally ends up where it belongs - behind bars! Create your own inmate and attempt to survive in a prison where every sentence is a \"death\" sentence. Rub shoulders with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling facility of 12 unique areas, each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond the gates populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different laws to keep you as far away from it as possible.Each day, you will find your health and mental state slipping away. Both can be restored by sleeping - which is also a good way to pass time. You won't always be permitted to sleep, though, so consuming food and drink bridges the gap. These, along with many other activities such as reading or watching TV, can also help to improve your mental state. If you \"lose your mind\" you will temporarily lose control of your character - and will almost certainly get into trouble!Your character also has a set of attributes that you are challenged to improve:- STRENGTH indicates how much damage you can inflict or absorb. You can improve it by fighting or lifting weights.- AGILITY determines how fast you move. You can improve it by jogging in the yard or scoring baskets.- INTELLECT reflects your knowledge - including fighting skills such as counters. You can improve it by reading books.- REPUTATION is how much other prisoners respect you. It can be improved by accomplishing tasks or intimidating others.There are also opportunities to earn money - whether you work for it with a broom, trade items at a profit, or run with a gang. Having money increases your opportunities to grease the wheels and make your life inside easier.You may find that you need to go to the toilet from time to time, in which case you must race to the bathroom! Alternatively, you could find a toilet to sit on or grab some toilet paper to spare your blushes. Failing to do so will damage your reputation and mental state.I regret that there is more to this game than I could ever explain here, so I hope you enjoy figuring some things out for yourself!Upgrade to \"VIP\" to enjoy the full experience without ads - plus access to the editor that allows you to customize your character and every other.BASIC CONTROLS:(*Look out for tutorials within the actual game)A = Attack (on its own to kick, with a direction to punch)G = Grapple / Throw weaponR = RunP = Pick-Up / DropT = Taunt (interact with handheld props)OTHER CONTROLS- Press ATTACK and RUN together to launch a powerful attack.- Press any button with any direction (or none) in a grapple to trigger different moves.- Press RUN and PICK-UP together to set fire to a small object (which can then be used to set fire to a large object).- Touch the clock to pause the game and bring up options to exit.- Touch any speech bubble to speed through conversations.PERFORMANCE- If you find your device struggles to display lots of characters, considering keeping the \"Population\" option low.- \"Speed Up Frame Rate\" sleeping will require good performance at the default frame rate.- Head to the \"Display\" options to tone down other features.",

                "  Great game.  Needs to be refined.  Needs more worlds and more vehicles.  Needs better graphics on vehicles.  Would be awesome if you could interchange parts on different vehicles, like put the Jeep tires on the monster truck and vice versa.  It would be awesome if the tank had a shell or two to shoot to level a hill, otherwise what is the point of the tank.  Maybe other worlds where there are power ups/nitrous instead of regular gas...  Needs a rocket powered car! Overall great game! "

I check my chips before the hand starts and if I am not big or small blind  10, 000 chips are gone anyway. And if I win the hand I add my winnings and they are not there. Why and where do those chips go????? Hope u all check ur chips. "

Also it gives the opportunity to share applications, bookmarks, contacts, and clipboard content by generating a barcode that can be scanned by another phone. Another nice and useful feature is to turn on/off flashlight during code scanning.  However, there are some minor drawbacks. First, after scanning a contact QR-code, one cannot create a new contact from it: if you press 'Add contact' button, a list of your contacts is shown instead of new contact dialog. Second, if you press 'Send email' button after scanning a contact, it shows a list of all applications that can share information, but it would be sensible to show only those that are connected with email (for instance, Mail, Gmail, and Hangouts apps). Third, if some text, SMS, or URL is scanned, it is more sensible to let a user two choices: to make a specific action (like web search for a text, send a message for a SMS, or open in a browser for a URL) or to share it using apps installed on a phone.

        "description": "Advanced Task Killer is also known as ATK which is #1 task kill (manage) app. It is a tool to kill applications running. -Ignore List-One tap widget-Auto kill-Customize item heightATK is often used to kill app and clean memory. We do suggest people use ATK manually kill apps instead of auto killing app.1. How to use it (for new users to quick start)?ATK is pretty simple. Open this tool and take a look at the running applications list? Uncheck some apps you don't want to kill (such as Advanced Task Killer and some system apps) Tap the button 'Kill selected apps', it will kill all applications checked. 2. How to use it (for new users to do more)?If you don't want to kill any app, you can tap it on the running applications list. Then it's checking box will turn to gray. 3. Why there are app running that I haven't used or even opened?Some app will start up once you turn on your phone or be invoked by some events. 4. What is ignore list/ignore?Ignore list is for you to ignore some app you don't want to kill. If you long press on the app listed on the main screen of ATK, the menu will pop up, then you can select 'Ignore', the application would be moved to ignore list. When you tap 'Kill selected apps', it won't be killed any more. 5. What is default action for long press?You can set your default action for long press and click on the settings. The system default action for long press is pop-menu. That means you when you long press on the application (displays on the running applications list), a pop-menu would shows up. For example, if you want to switch to the application after you long press on it, you can set the default action of long press to 'Switch to'. 6. Why I lost my network connection after I tap 'kill selected apps'? This is because some apps related with network connection are killed, such as 'voicemail'. You can ignore it instead of killing it. 7. Why my Home reloaded?This is because some apps related with Home are killed. Such as 'HTC Sense', 'Mail'(if it is integrated with Home). You can ignore it instead of killing it. 8. Why I cannot receive notification of Email?This is because you killed 'Email'. Instead of killing it, you need to ignore it. 9. What is Auto Kill?If you want to kill apps automatically you need to choose one of auto-kill level- Safe: Only kill the apps aren't running but still consume memory.- Aggressive: Kill the apps running background and apps aren't running.- Crazy: All apps except for apps you are using with.You should be able to see Auto Kill information shows on the title, like 'Auto-Kill: 12:20'. That means auto kill will start at 12:20, you can also change the frequency to impact the auto kill start time. App killer is only a tool to kill apps and task. It won't help your battery directly. But if you kill any app which consumes battery a lot, you might think app killer is helping your battery.Advanced Task Killer Pro is paid version which doesn't contain ads.Note: For android 2.2 and later version, task manager cannot kill services and front apps, you have to force stop them. If you use task manager to kill them, services might restart; also notification won't be erased from the top bar. So we don't suggest people use task manager kill them.KW: taskiller taskkiller task killer taskmanager manager panel taskpanel process app killer, task killer pro",

The issue with android cell phones is that there is no close option for the apps, they get minimized and continuously work in the background and eat up all the RAM and slow the processing of the phone. But this app kills the apps that are not required to be run in background and gives the user the option to choose which app to close and which not to. The reason I've not given 5 stars is that there are some bugs in this app like, after killing the applications the phone freezes and I've to reboot it to get it working properly. "

Only thing missing   just like the Met Office app there is no active lighting radar available for Uk!! Having been on the receiving end of a strike knowing/seeing the storm/strike activity, storm direction regularity or intensity would be of interest.. & I'll happily move it up to a 5\u00e2\u02dc\u2026 rating..  It's fairly obvious when lightning is overhead as I know all too well!! "

Drag racing is a well-conceived, well executed racer that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep petrolheads coming back for more.\" - Michael Brook, Life of Android ***TIPS:0. Updating the game- Your cars and money are saved on your device. DO NOT EVER uninstall the game before updating, or you will lose ALL of your stuff.1. Racing- Launch and shift when the dashboard indicator turns blue or green - If there is too much wheelspin, you are not going anywhere - watch the orange indicator on your dashboard - Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy - Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial!2. Cars and upgrades- Test drive before you buy a car!- The more your car costs, the tougher opposition you'll face both offline and online- Upgrades count towards increasing car cost/level, while tuning doesn't- Keep your car cost just under your level cap to get an advantage- Adjusting gear ratios (Garage -> Upgrade -> Tune) is costly, but lets you achieve times that are impossible on stock settings3. Game modes and winnings- Race against beginner/amateur AI to get some quick cash and build your car- Defeat bosses and unlock achievements for extra RP- Go online and race against others to earn maximum cash/RP- If your car isn't ready for online races, earn some cash in \"Drivers Battle\"- For the ultimate challenge, race against top players in Pro League4. Misc- Like http://facebook.com/DragRacingGame for news and strategy- Visit the official forums: http://www.dragracingforum.net- Try playing with vibration on (enable it in the \"Settings\" menu)!- If the game runs slow on your phone, use the task manager to kill unnecessary background tasks- XPERIA PLAY Optimized",

Run our app while charging to let Battery Doctor manage the process with its Unique 3 Stage Charging system that ensures a longer battery life.Use the \"Task Killer\" widget to optimize your power consumption convenientlyQ: What is a full charge and why does it matter?A: Plug in your phone when the battery has about 20% remaining and continue to charge until Battery Doctor tells you the 3rd stage of trickle charging is complete. Do not overcharge by keeping your device plugged in nor undercharge by charging in short bursts whenever convenient. Q: How does \"Saving Mode\" work?A: \"Saving Mode\" is an extreme setting that shuts down all non-essential functions of your phone with exception of making phone calls and sending/receiving text messages. WiFi, Data, GPS, etc will all be shut down to ensure battery life and defend your juice.Q: How do I set up the widgets?A: The \"Task Killer\" widget will automatically appear on your home screen with installation.  The other widget that monitors WiFi/GPS/etc can be installed just as any other widget on your device would be set up.======================================================================Twitter.com/ksbatterydoctorFacebook.com/ksbatterydoctor",

Somewhere out there is the perfect storm of touchscreen technology to fix everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with your life. And maybe all you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re missing is the iFruit app. Maybe not. At least you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have something to keep you entertained while your significant other prattles on endlessly about their day. iFruit hooks directly into your experience of Grand Theft Auto V with some fun activities to further postpone the need for real social interaction. Keep up-to-date on the latest Grand Theft Auto V news, log into the Rockstar Games Social Club, stay connected on LifeInvader and launch other Rockstar Games apps. Los Santos Customs The Los Santos Customs app offers players the freedom to create their ultimate vehicle in Grand Theft Auto V from anywhere. At the bar, on the beach, on the toilet. This is the future, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re almost sure of it. You can even create and reserve custom license plates for both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online \u00e2\u20ac\u201c order your personalized plates before they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gone! Also choose from paint jobs, window tints, smoke colors, wheels, hoods and spoilers. Upgrade your engine, brakes, exhaust, suspension, and accessorize with new lights, horns, tires and body armor. Place your order on-the-go and find it waiting for you in the garage the next time you play Grand Theft Auto V, or send your order in while playing and get a call from your local mechanic to swing by. Everybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had some work done in Los Santos, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let your ride be the exception to the rule. Chop the Dog Depth of content, high production values, defecation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the app that has it all. Because who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t love tending to a virtual pet? Chop is Franklin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s canine sidekick in Grand Theft Auto V. Look after him well in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chop the Dog\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd app and you will reap the benefits when playing as Franklin in Grand Theft Auto V. Pet him, feed and water him, play fetch and tug-of-war, teach him tricks. Too much or too little of an activity, however, will cause Chop to become unhappy, and nobody likes an unhappy Rottweiler. Take Chop on walks to give him a chance to work off last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steak and Piswasser and to mark his turf in the hood - defending his ladies, fending off gang members and even protecting the beach babes of Los Santos from unsightly tan lines by removing their bikinis. Looking after Chop successfully is reflected in his behavior in Grand Theft Auto V in a number of ways: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 He will be more helpful and responsive to Franklin \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 He will perform tricks such as sitting, begging and giving paw if properly trained through the app \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 He will sniff out the nearest hidden items when the player takes him for a walk \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Earn enough credits through walks and proper caretaking and exchange them for new collars for ChopFor information about supported devices and compatibility, please see: http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200628778",

We are aware of this and are working with Google to address the issue.2) While you can use your existing Smule account with Magic Piano on Android, the content of the apps differ substantially, and consequently songs and Smoola are not shared between iOS and Android. Thank you for your understanding.3) For some devices where we know there are issues, we have restricted installs for now. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S II has audio bugs in the phone itself that make the Magic Piano experience... well, not so magical. However, Android hardware and software are constantly improving so if we are able to support some of these devices in the future we absolutely will!",
