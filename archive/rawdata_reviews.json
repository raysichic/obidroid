Would have given it 5 stars if picks weren't required for quests or you earned more to use for the quests. You get stuck with no quests that you can complete because they require picks you have to buy with real money. Good idea for a game but poorly executed.

I wish the reviews indicated that it works. But it needs a complete integration with all data types that the real Google Earth supports.) And it would tell me what coordinates I'm pointing to. And a real Google Earth would have a scale bar! I keep on seeing references about it being able to compute routes but I don't see any options to do that. Touching the \"Google Earth\" logo (upper left) brings up the layer selection but only if I've brought up the Settings menu at least once during the session. There's no distance scale. And when I specify coordinates, it quite often doesn't recognize the input or plots the point wrong when it does. (It doesn't systematically know that latitude INCREASES \"\"UPWARDS\"!) And the 9/25 and 10/3 updates maintained the status quo. I'd uninstall it if Google Maps had a Share option. The 10/10 update degraded coordinate input. The 11/5 update didn't fix/add anything.

I check my chips before the hand starts and if I am not big or small blind  10, 000 chips are gone anyway. And if I win the hand I add my winnings and they are not there.

Another nice and useful feature is to turn on/off flashlight during code scanning.  However, there are some minor drawbacks. First, after scanning a contact QR-code, one cannot create a new contact from it: if you press 'Add contact' button, a list of your contacts is shown instead of new contact dialog. Second, if you press 'Send email' button after scanning a contact, it shows a list of all applications that can share information, but it would be sensible to show only those that are connected with email (for instance, Mail, Gmail, and Hangouts apps). Third, if some text, SMS, or URL is scanned, it is more sensible to let a user two choices: to make a specific action (like web search for a text, send a message for a SMS, or open in a browser for a URL) or to share it using apps installed on a phone.
