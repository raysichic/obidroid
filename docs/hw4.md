## Q3: 

__Use the stock market data of HW2. Do hierarchical clustering of the stocks in the SP500, based on their daily returns. Comment briefly on the results. Explain briefly how you would use the results of the hierarchical clustering to display the covariance matrix of the stock returns. (You can use a subset of the data of course; just say which subset)__
